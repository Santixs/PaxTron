# PaxTron

The aim of this project is to develop the basis of a game to be able to train a neural network with reinforcement learning in the future.

When finished it will be a mix between some games, Tron, PacMan and Snake.

This project is not finished yet, but the players and their movement, the "ownership" of the board tiles, the obstacles and the score among other things are already implemented, the next steps are to implement the enemies, the rewards and the visualizers for the players.

To play in the "manual" mode one player uses the wasd keys and the other the arrows, with the Esc button you enter the pause mode.

The game is developed with the aim of being very customizable so at the beginning of the first.py file many things can be customized (lives, speed, if players lose lives when hitting the walls, if players can go on their own tiles...)
